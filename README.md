# Neighbours-DAO
## testing
This is a testing space for the future implementations of the Neighbors-DAO, for Homework 5 in the Solidity class for the Masters in Digital Economics. It will implement tokens ($NGT & $NRT), with the desired properties, before pushing them into the main branch, present in this repository: [Neighbours-DAO](https://github.com/Tiny-boot/Neighbours-DAO)

In this testing space, the goal is to try different implementations of the two tokens, as well as try to make the two contracts interact with each other.

The tokens are largely based on the OpenZeppellin ERC20 models. The references to the contracts and the inspirations are given in the comments on the top of the contracts themselves.
