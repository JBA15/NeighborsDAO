# Neighbours-DAO
## testing
This is a testing space for the future implementations of the Neighbors-DAO, for Homework 5 in the Solidity class for the Masters in Digital Economics. It will implement tokens ($NGT & $NRT), with the desired properties, before pushing them into the main branch, present in this repository: [Neighbours-DAO](https://github.com/Tiny-boot/Neighbours-DAO)

In this testing space, the goal is to try different implementations of the two tokens, as well as try to make the two contracts interact with each other.

The tokens are largely based on the OpenZeppellin ERC20 models. The references to the contracts and the inspirations are given in the comments on the top of the contracts themselves.


# README.md file

At minimum, your README should contain these sections:

- Project Description - tiny summary (100 words or less) of the DAO and its token and governance model.

- Installation and Execution
    How to download and install the project (at the very least need npm and hardhat)
    Tests available (tiny 20 word description of each of the tests)
- Address of contracts on Sepolia.

The Design.md file must contain the following sections:
- Short technical specification and diagram show contract and function interaction (You may ask the two development teams to fill in this section or do it yourself)
    Chosen token standard - the token design has a bonus point here.
    Chosen governance process model
- Reflection
    What was the motivation in the chosen token and governance model? Eg. Better engagement? simple voting?
    Did you encounter any technical difficulties like merge conflicts?
    Did you encounter any interpersonal difficulties while managing the two development streams?
